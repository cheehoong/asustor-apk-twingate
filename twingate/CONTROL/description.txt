What is Twingate used for?
Twingate enables secure access to private resources or SaaS apps where IP-based access or whitelisting is required. Common use cases include connecting to third-party services or apps that restrict access by IP, securing staging servers, or deploying a lightweight cloud security access broker (CASB).

How is Twingate different from a VPN?
Unlike a VPN, even if you have multiple secure networks, Twingate handles routing to each of them transparently and users don't have to select a specific gateway that would give them access to a specific network.
